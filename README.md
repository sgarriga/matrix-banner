# matrix-banner
Create a terminal banner by highlighting the 1s &amp; 0s of the ASCII value of each character.<br>
E.g.,<br>
![example banner](https://github.com/sgarriga/matrix-banner/blob/main/banner.gif "Example Banner")

Building is as simple as `gcc banner.c -lz`<br>
Then `./a.out "Welcome To The Matrix"` to run.<br>
